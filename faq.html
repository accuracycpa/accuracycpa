                 <h3>Q: Should I choose a monthly accountant or a less frequent accounting method?</h3>
                <p>A: Monthly accounting services provide substantially more value than annual services. If an accountant only sees your numbers once a year, it is too late to offer advice that could help to make that year more profitable. Plus, it would certainly be too late to lower your tax liability for a year that is already over with.</p>

                 <h3>Q: What does the monthly accounting process look like?</h3>
                <p>A: Our monthly accounting process starts with receiving your source documents. Our staff compiles the information and reports back to you with a profit and loss statement, balance sheet, and general ledger. These monthly financial reports are presented in digital or hard copy form and become the foundation for our monthly conversations.</p>
